# JoeChopDatabase-

After knowing the requirement from Joe's Chop. 

Project Goal and benefits of this project
     The objectives of this project are to generate a web-based application that works in conjunction with a relational database in the background in order to increase efficiency and profit at the customization shop named Joe’ Chop. The Joe's chop team can use this web app to share the customization plan in detail with their customers showing progress information including final-fee information and customers can access this information online through this application. This will increase the communication between the staff and customers, which is of paramount importance for the growing business.

Aim for this project: 
    First DB-8 team members will build the relational database using the requirements gathered from the description from the document.  Following the development of the database, team members will implement the web application that connects to that database, so users can use that for running their business. Users will use data stored in databases to illustrate how vehicles are customized to suit specific clients' needs and can update the information accordingly.
